Implementation of RSA, DH Key Exchange, ElGamal, ElGamal Re-Encryption, Universal Re-Encryption using Python

RSA, also known as the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem, is a widely employed algo for ensuring secure communication by utilizing public and private keys. The underlying security of RSA is based on the challenging nature of factoring the product of two substantial prime numbers, commonly referred to as the "factoring problem."

DH (Diffie-Hellman) Key Exchange, is a secure mathematical technique used to exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel. It enables two parties without any prior knowledge of each other to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. This shared key can then be used to encrypt further communications using a symmetric-key cipher.

ElGamal encryption system, is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm used in public-key cryptography. It builds upon the principles of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. ElGamal encryption is applicable to cyclic groups like the multiplicative group of integers modulo n. The security of ElGamal encryption relies on the challenge of solving a specific problem related to computing discrete logarithms in the chosen group G.

ElGamal Re-Encryption, Universal Re-Encryption using Python are used for the implementation of Mixed Networks.
